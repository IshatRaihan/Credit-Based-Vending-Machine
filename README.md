# Credit-Based-Vending-Machine
To see how it works: https://youtu.be/rubB_oXeyKg

The main purpose of this project was to create a vending machine which could provide different types of snacks and items to the people on credit, simply and quickly. It is often difficult to get snacks in between classes when someone feels hungry. Going to the cafeteria would cost a lot of time which may not be available in busy day. To solve such a problem, we have come up with a solution that would allow anyone to use their student ID card as a credit card, to purchase item efficiently.

In conventional vending machines money validation and returning change is a big problem. To add to that, these machines do not accept the notes if they are torn or is an bad shape. To get rid of this, we made our vending machine to sell products on credit. Records are all kept in a server and email is sent as a purchase receipt after every delivery.
